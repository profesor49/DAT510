The whole hand-in is coded with java using the eclipse environment
The content of the directory handIn_1 is:

* handIn_1
	* poly.java
	* pair.java
	* DES.java
	* SDES.java
	* TripleSDES.java
	* README.txt
	* SimpleDESData
	* SimpleDESData.txt
	* TripleDESData.txt

There are no package that is require to be downloaded and implemented

The location of the files has to be changed in the DES.java, but
The code will also come up in the console. if you want to write
anything to the files, you need to delete the content of the file,
since it only write if the file is empty.

The file SimpleDESData contain all the attempt of decryption using 
all the keys, unfiltered. The file SimpleDESData.txt and TripleDESData.txt 
contain the key and decrypted message, filtered

All the relevant files for the work with poly-alphabetic substition is
* poly.java
* pair.java
Run the code at poly.java

All the relevant files for the work with SDES and TripleSDES is
* DES.java
* SDES.java
* TripleSDES.java
* README.txt
* SimpleDESData
* SimpleDESData.txt
* TripleDESData.txt
Run the code at DES.java
