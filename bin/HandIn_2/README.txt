The whole hand-in is coded with java using the eclipse environment
The content of the directory handIn_2 is:

* HandIn_2
	* Person.java
	* Run.java
	* SDES.java
	* README.txt
	
There are no package that is require to be downloaded and implemented

The SDES.java is the same file used in the previous handIn, but isn't
required to know, but it is used in the Person.java class. Person.java
does most of the calculation.

file called Exchange(), which does the Diffie-Hillman key exchange
